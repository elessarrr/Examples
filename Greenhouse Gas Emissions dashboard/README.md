# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dashboard

A Dash-based web application for visualizing and analyzing greenhouse gas emissions data, designed for business stakeholders to gain actionable insights.

## Development Milestones

1. **Data Foundation** - Set up data processing pipeline and establish core data models for emissions analysis
2. **Dashboard Framework** - Create the basic dashboard structure with filterable components and responsive layout
3. **Visualization Suite** - Implement interactive charts and graphs to showcase emissions trends and patterns
4. **Business Insights Layer** - Add analytical components that highlight key business metrics and compliance indicators
5. **Deployment & Documentation** - Finalize deployment process and create comprehensive documentation for stakeholders

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Dash (Python-based framework for building analytical web applications)
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly (Interactive, publication-quality graphs for business intelligence)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- **Data Storage**: Excel files (Familiar format for business users)
- **Deployment**: Docker container (For easy deployment and scalability)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8050

## Data Format

The application uses Excel files (.xlsx) containing emissions data with the following structure:
- Facility information (location, industry type)
- Emissions data by subpart (categorized by emission source)
- Temporal data (yearly records for trend analysis)

## Business Use Cases

- Track emissions trends across different states and facilities
- Identify compliance risks and opportunities for reduction
- Generate visual reports for stakeholder presentations
- Compare performance across different business units or regions
- Support data-driven sustainability decision making

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dash 2.14.2+
- Pandas 2.1.4+
- Plotly 5.18.0+
- Openpyxl 3.1.2+ (for Excel file processing)

## Development

To add new features or modify existing ones:
1. Create/modify components in the components/ directory
2. Update data processing logic in utils/
3. Modify app.py to integrate changes
4. Test thoroughly before deploying
