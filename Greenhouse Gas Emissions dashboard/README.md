# Enterprise Emissions Analytics Platform

A production-grade analytics platform that transforms greenhouse gas emissions data into actionable business intelligence. Built with modern data visualization technologies, this solution enables data-driven sustainability decisions across enterprise operations.

## Core Capabilities

- **Analytics Engine**: Processes and visualizes greenhouse gas emissions data
- **Interactive Visualization**: Custom-built dashboard components for emissions breakdown and trends
- **Data Processing**: Efficient data filtering and aggregation with caching
- **Compliance Support**: EPA subpart-based emissions tracking and reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Dash (React-based)
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts
- **Components**: Modular design with state and subpart breakdown graphs

### Backend
- **Data Processing**: Pandas with LRU caching and optimized aggregations
- **Storage Layer**: File-based data storage
- **State Management**: Dash callbacks with efficient data flow patterns

### DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- **Monitoring**: Integrated performance metrics and logging

## Performance Optimizations

- Implemented LRU caching for data queries with 128 entry cache size
- Optimized data processing with efficient Pandas operations
- Modular component architecture with separate state and subpart graphs
