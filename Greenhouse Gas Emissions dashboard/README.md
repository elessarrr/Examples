# GHG Emissions Analytics Dashboard

A web-based analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing greenhouse gas emissions data. Built with Python and Dash, this application provides interactive charts and filtering capabilities to help understand emissions patterns across different states, time periods, and EPA subparts.

## üéØ Business Impact

This dashboard helps users explore emissions data through:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: EPA subpart-based emissions tracking and reporting
- **Strategic Planning**: Multi-dimensional analysis across states, time periods, and emission sources
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time visualization of emissions trends and patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of high-emission areas and compliance gaps

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Dash (React-based) with modular component design
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts
- **UI**: Responsive design with filtering and navigation
- **Components**: Reusable components with clear separation of concerns

### Backend
- **Data Processing**: Pandas operations with caching strategies
- **Performance**: Multi-tier caching (LRU, Smart Cache) for improved response times
- **Architecture**: Event-driven callback system with debouncing
- **Storage**: Parquet-based data storage with compression

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment
- **Server**: Gunicorn + Gevent for production serving
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and memory usage tracking
- **Testing**: Test suite covering components and utilities
