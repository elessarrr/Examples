# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Architecture Analysis
1. The app uses `lru_cache` for data caching in `utils/cache_utils.py`
2. Callbacks are triggered for every state selection and year range adjustment
3. Data processing happens in `utils/aggregation.py`
4. Both state and subpart graphs update independently

## Step-by-Step Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Caching (Safest, Minimal Changes)
1. Optimize existing caching:
   - Increase `lru_cache` size from 128 to better suit data volume
   - Add intermediate caching for aggregated results
   - Cache graph layout configurations

### Phase 2: Callback Optimization
1. Implement debouncing for rapid input changes:
   - Add new `utils/callback_utils.py` for debounce logic
   - Prevent unnecessary updates during rapid slider movements

### Phase 3: Data Processing Optimization
1. Create new `utils/data_preprocessor.py`:
   - Pre-aggregate common data combinations
   - Optimize DataFrame operations
   - Add progress tracking for long operations

### Phase 4: Graph Rendering Optimization
1. Optimize Plotly configurations:
   - Reduce data points when appropriate
   - Cache static graph elements
   - Optimize layout calculations

## Implementation Strategy

### Safety Measures
1. Version Control:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/performance-optimization
   ```

2. Backup Critical Files:
   ```bash
   cp utils/cache_utils.py utils/cache_utils.py.backup
   cp utils/aggregation.py utils/aggregation.py.backup
   ```

3. Testing Framework:
   - Add performance benchmarks in `tests/`
   - Measure response times before/after changes
   - Ensure all existing tests pass

### Rollback Plan
1. Quick Rollback:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git branch -D feature/performance-optimization
   ```

2. File Restoration:
   ```bash
   cp utils/cache_utils.py.backup utils/cache_utils.py
   cp utils/aggregation.py.backup utils/aggregation.py
   ```

## Implementation Order

1. Start with Phase 1 (Enhanced Caching):
   - Lowest risk, uses existing infrastructure
   - Immediately measurable results
   - No changes to core logic

2. Move to Phase 2 (Callback Optimization):
   - Add debouncing in new utility file
   - Keep original callback structure intact
   - Easy to disable if issues arise

3. Then Phase 3 (Data Processing):
   - Create new preprocessing module
   - Maintain original processing as fallback
   - Gradual migration to optimized methods

4. Finally Phase 4 (Graph Rendering):
   - Optimize after other bottlenecks addressed
   - Focus on visual performance
   - Keep original rendering as backup

## Success Metrics
1. Response Time:
   - Target: < 5 seconds for graph updates
   - Measure using browser dev tools

2. Memory Usage:
   - Monitor with system tools
   - Ensure no memory leaks

3. User Experience:
   - Smooth slider interaction
   - Responsive state selection

## For Junior Developers
1. Always run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

2. Check performance metrics:
   ```python
   import cProfile
   cProfile.run('function_to_test()')
   ```

3. Use version control:
   - Commit small, focused changes
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Keep backup copies of modified files

This plan prioritizes safety and reversibility while targeting the main performance bottlenecks. Each phase can be implemented and tested independently, with clear rollback paths if needed.
